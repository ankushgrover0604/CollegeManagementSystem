	<h3 class="mar1">Event Description</h3>
	<p class="mar1">The Symposium comprises two parts, namely Paeper
		Presentation and Idea Presentation. In our quest to leave no stone
		unturned, both sessions have been designed to incorporate
		participation from all categories of students right from the schooling
		level to the post-graduation level. The topics for the presentation
		range from biomedical robotics to aerial and terrestrial guided
		vehicles, encompassing all critical realms of research and development
		including, but not restricted to intelligent robotics, security
		applications and mechanisms like mobile manipulators. Also being dealt
		with, will be entries pertaining to the 4th wave of industrialization
		such as the internet of things, smart manufacturing and cognitive
		computing among others. The Paper Presentation will function as an
		excellent platform for young, ambitious research students who have put
		their acquired knowledge and skill to the fore and come forward to
		showcase their enterprising work. Exemplary presentations have an
		opportunity to get recognized profusely by virtue of the superlative
		reach of the event. The Idea Presentation is chiefly conducted to
		cater to the multifarious desiderata of budding research aspirants who
		are at the outset of their professional careers, but nevertheless,
		would feature novel and path-breaking projects from all students. An
		audacious idea is the spark that ignites the wildfire of technological
		innovation, and the audience are bound to witness many an idea of said
		nature during the course of this session. The Symposium would be
		embellished with an abundance of insightful interactions by eminent
		luminaries from the field of RAS and beyond, which would enrich the
		students with invaluable information and cognizance that would prove
		fruitful in the quests we wish our students to undertake and hope to
		be prepared for on the back of it.</p>
