# CollegeManagementSystem
This is a basic college management system project in which different roles has been assigned to different authorities of a college.
I have made entire project in Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers - 2020-03.
I have used JSP and SERVLETS for backend purposes and HTML,CSS,BOOTSTRAP for frontend.
All the main files are present in webcontent folder of the project and one can run the project by --Home.jsp-- file which is the main and first file of the project.
Also i have used MySQL for storing all the data and i have stored it all at localhost. I have shared a folder named database_images in this project which could give you an idea regarding database and tables(with what columns) you need to make for running this project succesfuly.
Thanks and regards.
